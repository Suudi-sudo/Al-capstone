### Code Breakdown

#### 1. Package Declaration and Imports
\`\`\`go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "time"
)
\`\`\`
- `package main`: Declares this as an executable program
- `import`: Brings in standard library packages we need
- `fmt`: Formatted I/O (printing, string formatting)
- `log`: Logging utilities
- `net/http`: HTTP client and server implementations
- `time`: Time-related functions

#### 2. Handler Functions
\`\`\`go
func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Function that handles HTTP requests
}
\`\`\`
- **Handler function**: Processes incoming HTTP requests
- `w http.ResponseWriter`: Used to write the response back to client
- `r *http.Request`: Contains information about the incoming request
- **Pointer (`*`)**: Go uses pointers for efficiency with large structs

#### 3. HTML Response Generation
\`\`\`go
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
html := `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
response := fmt.Sprintf(html, time.Now().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"), ...)
\`\`\`
- **Headers**: Set response content type
- **Template literals**: Using backticks for multi-line strings
- **String formatting**: `fmt.Sprintf` works like printf in other languages
- **Time formatting**: Go uses a specific reference time for formatting

#### 4. Server Setup and Routing
\`\`\`go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)
mux.HandleFunc("/api", apiHandler)
\`\`\`
- **Multiplexer (mux)**: Routes requests to appropriate handlers
- **HandleFunc**: Registers a handler function for a specific path
- **Root path (`/`)**: Catches all requests not matched by other routes

#### 5. Server Startup
\`\`\`go
if err := http.ListenAndServe(port, mux); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Server failed to start:", err)
}
\`\`\`
- **ListenAndServe**: Starts the HTTP server
- **Error handling**: Go's explicit error handling pattern
- **log.Fatal**: Prints error and exits if server fails to start

### Key Go Concepts Demonstrated

#### 1. Functions
\`\`\`go
func functionName(parameter type) returnType {
    // function body
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Error Handling
\`\`\`go
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Structs and Methods
\`\`\`go
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
// w is a struct, Header() is a method, Set() is a method on the returned value
\`\`\`

#### 4. String Formatting
\`\`\`go
fmt.Sprintf("Hello %s, the time is %s", name, time)
\`\`\`

#### 5. Package System
- Code is organized into packages
- `main` package creates executable programs
- Import other packages to use their functionality

##  Common Issues & Solutions

### Installation Issues

#### Issue: "go: command not found"
**Cause**: Go is not installed or not in PATH
**Solution**:
\`\`\`bash
# Check if Go is installed
which go  # Linux/macOS
where go  # Windows

# If not found, reinstall Go and ensure it's added to PATH
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc (Linux/macOS):
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# On Windows, the installer should handle PATH automatically
\`\`\`

#### Issue: "cannot find package" errors
**Cause**: Module not initialized or incorrect import paths
**Solution**:
\`\`\`bash
# Initialize module if not done
go mod init github.com/Suudi-sudo/Al-capstone

# Clean up dependencies
go mod tidy

# Verify module file exists
cat go.mod
\`\`\`

### Runtime Issues

#### Issue: "listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use"
**Cause**: Another process is using port 8080
**Solutions**:
\`\`\`bash
# Option 1: Find and kill the process
lsof -i :8080  # Linux/macOS
netstat -ano | findstr :8080  # Windows

# Option 2: Change port in main.go
port := ":8081"  // or any other available port

# Option 3: Kill all Go processes (be careful!)
pkill go  # Linux/macOS
taskkill /f /im go.exe  # Windows
\`\`\`

#### Issue: "404 page not found" when accessing server
**Cause**: Incorrect URL or handler not registered properly
**Solutions**:
- Verify server is running (check terminal output)
- Check URL: `http://localhost:8080` (not https)
- Verify handler registration in code
- Check for typos in HandleFunc calls

#### Issue: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
**Cause**: Server not running or firewall blocking connection
**Solutions**:
- Verify server started successfully (check terminal)
- Check firewall settings
- Try different browser
- Verify port number matches code and URL

### Code Issues

#### Issue: "undefined: http" or similar import errors
**Cause**: Missing import statements
**Solution**:
\`\`\`go
import (
    "net/http"  // Make sure this is included
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "time"
)
\`\`\`

#### Issue: "syntax error" messages
**Common causes and fixes**:
\`\`\`go
// Missing semicolons (Go adds them automatically, but watch for edge cases)
// Incorrect brace placement (opening brace must be on same line)
if condition {  // Correct
    // code
}

// Not this:
if condition 
{  // This will cause an error
    // code
}

// Missing return statements in functions that should return values
func getValue() string {
    return "value"  // Don't forget this!
}
\`\`\`

### Development Workflow Issues

#### Issue: Changes not reflected when refreshing browser
**Cause**: Need to restart server after code changes
**Solution**:
- Stop server (Ctrl+C)
- Run `go run main.go` again
- Refresh browser

#### Issue: "go build" creates unexpected file names
**Cause**: Go uses directory name or module name for executable
**Solution**:
\`\`\`bash
# Specify output name explicitly
go build -o myserver main.go

# Or rename the executable after building
go build main.go
mv main myserver  # Linux/macOS
ren main.exe myserver.exe  # Windows
\`\`\`

### Performance and Best Practices

#### Issue: Server seems slow or unresponsive
**Potential causes and solutions**:
- **Infinite loops in handlers**: Check your handler code for loops
- **Blocking operations**: Avoid long-running tasks in handlers
- **Resource leaks**: Make sure to close resources properly

#### Issue: Code organization becomes messy
**Solutions**:
- Split handlers into separate functions
- Consider separate files for different functionality
- Use Go's package system for larger projects

### Testing and Debugging

#### Issue: Hard to test the server manually
**Solutions**:
\`\`\`bash
# Use curl for quick testing
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/api

# Use browser developer tools to inspect responses
# F12 -> Network tab -> Refresh page

# Add logging to your handlers for debugging
log.Printf("Received request: %s %s", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
\`\`\`

#### Issue: Unclear error messages
**Solution**: Add more detailed logging:
\`\`\`go
log.Printf("Server starting on port %s", port)
if err := http.ListenAndServe(port, mux); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Server failed to start: %v", err)
}
\`\`\`
