##  Final Reflection

Using AI to learn Go and build this web server was incredibly effective. The AI served as a patient tutor, debugging partner, and documentation assistant. However, the real learning happened when I took the AI's guidance and applied it through hands-on coding, debugging, and iteration.

The key insight is that AI is a powerful learning accelerator, but it works best when combined with active practice, community engagement, and official documentation. This project wouldn't have been possible in 4 days without AI assistance, but it also wouldn't have been meaningful without the struggle of actually writing, debugging, and understanding the code myself.

For future learners: Use AI boldly to get started and overcome barriers, but don't let it replace the essential work of thinking, practicing, and building understanding through experience.
